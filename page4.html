        <h1>Java Island and the Programming Language</h1><br>
        <h2>Java and Java Coffee – Do you like coffee?</h2><br>
        <p>Java Island as a mountainous country with a volcanic belt and alluvial plain areas it is a great productor of raw material or primary agricultural products as rice, tea, sugar cane, textiles, tobacco, and rubber. Among these commodities there is one very special and famous as a unique product from Java Island: coffee!</p>
       <br><br><br><br>

       <br><br><br><br>
        <p>In 1991, when James Gosling, the developer of Java Programming language was deciding for a name for what he and his team had created, he named the language as “Oak”. This name popped up to his mind because while he was developing it, he was staring at an oak tree outside his office window. But as we all know it now, the language, in the end, was named JAVA and as its logo a couple of steam coffee was elected.
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <img class="homepic" src="Images/james.jpg" alt="alt"/>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <p>The whole team behind the development of Java was searching for another good name because it was discovered that “Oak” was the name of the programming language of Sun Microsystems that Gosling had created initially for their set-top box project, which created copyright issues. But they could not find one. Then one day, after several hours of brainstorming, they got an inspiration when they took a trip to a local coffee shop for a break with Gosling. 
        Most of programmers simply love coffee, some surveys says that they have an average of having coffee 3.2 times a day!! Indonesia is one of the biggest coffee producers of the world due to its great weather and location condition for growing it.  In addition, Java island is one of the most famous Indonesian coffee producers in southeast of Asia!
        </p>

        <br><br><br><br>
        <p>Finally, inspired by Java Coffee, after that day at the coffee shop, they named the language JAVA and the logo was designed to be a small cup with hot coffee!! As it is till now. 
            <br><br><br>
            Enjoy your Java, ops, coffee!

            <h1>What is Java?</h1>
            <p>Java is a programming language that is widely used on the World Wide Web, both in Web pages (client side) and on Web servers (computers used to host or maintain Web sites). Therefore, it is an important technical component of e-commerce. Based on a high-level programming language called C++, the most popular, powerful aspect of Java is that it allows programmers to create programs that can be downloaded onto computers regardless of their operating systems (programs like Windows used for controlling a computer's basic operations).
                Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1991 for use in consumer devices. However, it soon found a place on the Web when Sun made it available for that purpose in the mid-1990s. In the early 2000s, Web browsers like Netscape Navigator, cellular phones, and personal digital assistants were being specifically designed to support the Java programming language.
